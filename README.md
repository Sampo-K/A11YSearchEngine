# A11YSearchEngine
Backup of the A11Y search engine code
React based A11Y search engine.

## Running
Needs configuration, does not run out of the box. Code is here just for storing. Should run if copied to Codepen though. Working copy available at [Codepen](https://codepen.io/SampoSampoSampo/full/OJgKroK).

## Dependencies
* React
* JSON files need to be uploaded in Codepen (most likely yours as my URLS might not work for you due to cross origin requests).

### Generating JSON
There is script included for fetching the necessary data from W3C sites and generating JSON for any desired WCAG 2.1 or 2.2 language version. Dependencies of the script are
* axios
* json-web-crawler

Settings of the parser can be set in the settings.js file.
